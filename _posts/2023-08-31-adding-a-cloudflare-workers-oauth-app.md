Hi all,

I have finally figured out how to integrate my CMS application (Decap CMS) with Github Pages with login functionality.

So far, I've leveraged \`al-folio\`'s Jekyll project, \`decap-cms\` for Jekyll-style posts, and now \`sveltia-cms-auth\` for their easy integration with decap-cms' GitHub backend.

This is just in time for my trip to Jordan! I might have to open a travel blog soon. :)
