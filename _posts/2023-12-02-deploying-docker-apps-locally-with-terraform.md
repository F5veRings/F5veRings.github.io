I liked my old website. I want it to be a proper CMS application now! Since I have some experience with PHP, I've opted for Drupal. This guide will use Terraform from the outset to provision our application. The point of the tutorial is to familiarize onselef with Terraform at each stage, creating CI/CD for each environment until it makes it to production.
