To Whom It May Concern: 

It has recently come to my attention that we only have 8 billion days (rounded up to the nearest billion) until our dear Sun expires. Now, if this fact alone is making you quake with existential phantods, fret now; it's only going to get worse. Picture this-- Apollo is a giant giddy with booze, armed with only a handful of arrows (eight billion, rounded up to the nearest billion), shooting them up at the sky one by one. The directive might've been, a long time ago, to shoot us dead. But dear Apollo, perhaps, is taking a stand and today decided to look the other way. Either way, there will come a day where the quiver runs dry, or even worse-- dear Apollo hits the mark and shoots us right in the heart. In honor of our impending demise, I have taken it upon myself to brew a (lightly roasted) pot of coffee, and chronicle each arrow in real time, from the moment it leaves its bow, to when it lands God knows where. The coffee is done brewing, but the arrow is still up in the sky. I would spill a little of my coffee in honor of the poor sod to catch it from Apollo today, but I am recently unemployed and coffee is very expensive.

Cheers-- we'll all be dead soon,

Martin
