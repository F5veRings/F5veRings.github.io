To Whom It May Concern:



Look-- Another arrow shooting up and away from the eastern front. 

I haven't checked my notes, but I'd say there's only eight billion arrows left, rounded up to the nearest billion for your comfort. 

I know what you're thinking. You want to say "Martin, there's no rush. I'm a learned man/woman/non-binary erudite. The Earth is round and there's only the one Arrow, ever screaming overhead."

Or you might \*also\* be a heretic, and go as far as to say "that's not an Arrow at all! It actually stays perfectly still, and it is Us that rotate/fly around it etc".

You've been lied to about all that. That Apollo's Arrows are infinite or last forever-- that's a lie of comfort made to take each one of them for granted. In real life, do you ever look at an arrow headed your way and say "Egad! I'll be late for dinner!"?!

No. If you're lucky, you might have time to utter a quick blessing ("Dear, dear, dear, God..."). Usually, though, it's a one word ejaculation-- religious, scatological or sexual in nature. Our life's preoccupations boiled down to four letters or less. 

Speaking of scatological , let me digress a minute here, since we're all already dead anyway.

Most of you might think I'm talking about the end times, saying I'm prone to wax eschatological. You're sort of half right, thanks to serendipitous convergent etymology. My point is that at the end of everything, once anything is synthesized, assimilated, and digested, be it the Book of Apocalypsis, David Foster Wallace's magnum opus Infinite Jest, or the Oopsie No Poopsie aromatic oil whose packaging you chortled over with your funcle at the Tukwila Mall, but especially Ideas (be it brilliant or dull), is all really the same thing once the shoe hits the floor: shit. That's all the end times are-- our life's work revealed as a little pile that you just hope someone else will stumble upon and carry with, add to their own and even polish to a shine. Truth be told painfully, oftentimes their own hands are already full with other peoples'. Anyway. Back to my maint point-- the death of today's Arrow.



Take a good look at the \[Sun]. It's Apollo's gift to some poor old sod, maybe to no one and everyone in particular, maybe aimed right at Apollo's own chest (if the round Earth theory is valid, anyway). Don't shed a tear no matter what, lest the \[Sun] in your eye drown. 

Let it burn inside your eye's heart and carry on; perhaps in this way, that arrow can be salvaged, forever a little twinkling turd of what it once was. Just for today. Let it speak to you and guide your actions-- it has a voice (everything does).

Perhaps you'll have the courage to quit that job that's been holding you back on your happiness. Who needs that job when the Sun is literally dying overhead?

Maybe it will give you the chutzpah--yiddish for terminal velocity-- to escape the orbit of a failed relationship, or even better, to talk things out with that that person you love and resolve things in a way that makes you feel like you can die happy in a few hours alongside everyone else.

In all likelyhood, though, they don't love you back and they're actually living their best life--saying "I Love You" is a lie of convenience akin to saying "the sun will never die" or "I'll hit you up". It's what you tell someone in order for them to stop following you.

That's not your problem. Doth walk away scat-free-- Thou spakest thine peace... 

That actually reminds me of Julius Caesar's last joke. In honor of the end times-- I'll tell you how it went:



So, Julius Caesar, contrary to all popular belief, was the emperor because he was the most ruthless Truth or Dare player. Anything you asked him to do, he'd do-- that's actually how he started going around naked: someone dared him to eschew clothes forever.

He won literally everyone over with his fearless bravado, always doing the People's will no matter the cost.

But anyway, there's this guy who wins an audience with him, a dingleberry flushed down the annals of history as Brutus-- that's latin for "It Could Be You"-- who Truth or Dares him to, basically, kill himself. Julius Caesar loses his shit-- he literally laughs so hard he would've pooped on his robes had he worn any that day!

So he says to Brutus "Here's a man fit to be a King!" He makes Brutus his second in command, makes him go everywhere with him, gives him proper clothes and everything, basically treats him like his best friend. Now, in Roman culture, this is a Bad Thing-- Caesar invented the Roman Handshake for a reason--to pull people in a little Too Close. But Brutus knew nothing of royal customs-- he was just a jokester, and foreshadowing is bad for jokes.

So anyway, it's the Caesars' birthday, held at his summer mansion, and Brutus is the guest of honor. He arrives at sundown, duly on time. Everyone's already passed out drunk and on the floor. Except Caesar, who lords over the dregs of the reverie from his penthouse balcony.

As Brutus walks up the foyer, Caesar calls out to him in Latin: "Ah, Bruto! Hablando del rey de Roma!" 

He then, basically, slices his own throat and proceeds to take a quick trip down three floors headfirst. 



What's really funny about it though, was that at the end of it all, Brutus lied to the centurions and stated that \*he\* killed Caesar over a dare.

Caesar still laughs about it today and he won't let me live it down.
