Last blog's post got me a little bit riled up.
Like, why wait until the Sun dies for me to write another blog post?
I want to talk about another great leader and dear friend from ancient Mexico--
His friends called him The Dog (In Latin, Chucho, legal name was Jesus) on account of him always going barefoot and other customs traditionally associated with canines.

His running gag was that he would invite everyone over for barbecue and not actually make any food for other people-- just a couple loaves of bread and fish for himself. And so if people Not In The Loop went up to him to complain about the food, he'd point at the latrine, just past the berry bushes and buckwheat and say in latin:

-"Que no hay comida? Come caca!" (i.e. there's food and water at the bottom of that there well).

The gullible ones would really go into the latrine-- such was their eagerness to be loved by Jesus. (That's where the term "shit-eating grin" comes from, actually).
I, being a man of discernment, just picked a berry, ate it, and then said "no thanks, I'm full".

In his worldview, there were two kinds of people-- Trashes, and Shits. Trash goes in the trash bin, he'd say. 
Then, in latin, he'd add "Y las caquitas solitas se juntan" (Latin for "but you can be my friend instead") and go for a Christian hug (aka el abrazo del chucho, aka The Dog Lean).
Great man. If only his breath wasn't so bad... then again, he didn't like kissing.

And that's a twofer today.
